### What changed
`loop.ts` on main was a 9-byte stub (`see-local0`) after the claimed restore. Finished that work first: restored Loop from the last intact tree, then the falling-streak gate (`SCENT_FALL_STREAK = 4`, persist `scentFallStreak`) and the truncated `kernel.test.ts` suite.

One improvement: horizon 3. Imagination now takes a third predicted window from the best step-2 state. ρ̂ adds the residual drop step-2→step-3 so a wall can hide compressible structure one step later and still pay. Scores add `γ² · confidence · best3`. Law 04 / 05 and the act stage note the extra step. Auth off. UI untouched.

### Evidence
`node --experimental-strip-types --test src/lib/kernel/kernel.test.ts src/lib/kernel/scent-novelty.test.ts` — 23/23 pass (restored suite + novelty/ρ̂/streak + "horizon 3 scores a residual drop two steps past a wall"). `tsc --noEmit` clean. Production build succeeded. Preview on :8081 returns 200.

### Next hypothesis
Horizon 3 multiplies model error. Measure Field late ema, G2, and lives versus horizon 2 on the same seed. If G2 drops or lives rise, the third window is noise — gate it behind `ema < 0.12`. If G2 holds and foods rise in Rooms, try a cheap latent: predict hidden, not cells.
