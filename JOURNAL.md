Daily log of what changed, what was learned, next hypothesis.

Shipped Phase 0: a 5×5 local world-model (two-layer MLP, ~5k weights) trained online on prediction error, with curiosity as novelty plus falling surprise, and a body with energy. Five worlds (Field, Rooms, Spiral, Pulse, Blank). The loop is inspectable in the Lab / Laws / Loop views.

Hypothesis for next: the policy still cheats a little with reactive food-in-view. True compression-progress as intrinsic reward, plus a latent predictor (Phase 1), should make exploration less twitchy and walls more like a map.
